1. BJP to Power Again: Bharatiya Janata Party again became to power by bagging 240 seats, thus showcasing its strong presence all over the country.
2. Congress Position: Indian National Congress got 99 seats and was not replaced as the principal Opposition party in the Parliament. The party continued to be the main force in terms of Opposition.
3. Government Formation by Coalition: The failure of all the parties to secure over 50% of the total votes led them to support a coalition government to make up the majority and eventually, come into power.
4. New Voices*: The recent success of the creation of parties Voice of the People Party, 1 seat, and Zoram People's Movement, 1 seat, will have a significant impact in a political dimension.
5. Left-Wing Representation: Combined together the both Communist Party of India (Marxist) and the Communist Party of India Marxist-Leninist Red Star, yet altogether just 6 seats, confirming the Left ideology in the nation.
6. State-Specific Powerhouses*: Political activity is no longer confined to national election constituencies only; at the state level, there is also a strong showing of political activity through the seats won by Telugu Desam and Janata Dal (United) with 16 and 12 respectively.
7. Independent Success: Independents probably hold that they, unlike group-supported candidates, truly represent the people's will despite the fact that they have only secured some seats.
8. Regional Stride: A sensational victory of Samajwadi Party with 37 seats and All India Trinamool Congress with 29 seats creating another layer to the political map of the country was something that regional politics gained this time. The situation is actually unavailing new steps in political arenas at the state/region level, particularly among the parties like SP and AITC who won 37 and 29 seats respectively.
9. Altered Traditional Support: The electoral results, liability-wise, have been shared by parties such as Shiv Sena 7 and Nationalist Congress Party 8 who only managed to gain a few extra votes than before. They are pointing towards the break-down of the traditional voter base in this region.
10. Diverse Representation: The majority of winners among Indian political party scenes represented smaller parties, which clearly indicated fragmented fragmentation.
